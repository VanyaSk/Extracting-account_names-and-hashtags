# Extracting-account_names-and-hashtags
Out of the text data we want to get the most mentioned account names and hashtags (@ and #).
We take the caption of the post, extracting all the @ and # out of it. Loop this action for all the posts we hav in a dataset. 
Next step - get the flat list of all the mentiones and count for how many times each @ or # appered in our posts. 
At the end of the script we combine our results into a csv-file in a descending order (Z-A).
